It has become second nature to use Google reviews to look up new restaurants, to search for places to eat in new areas, or just to search for a restaurant with the type of food one is in the mood for. In any of these cases, restaurant rating is an extremely important feature that determines which restaurants users see first in many cases. For this reason, we chose to explore the Google Restaurants dataset to develop a predictive model. The google restaurant reviews dataset can be found here: https://github.com/zzxslp/Gest?tab=readme-ov-file. This dataset provides us with rich data that can be used in a predictive model.
In this notebook, I explore the google restaurant reviews dataset with some exploratory data analysis, and then go into different text-based models that utilize the actual text of each review. These models were implemented by processing the reviews into text embedding vectors through building a vocabulary vector. Different methods of text embedding were explored such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. Once these text embedding vectors were created to represent each review, we utilized regression analytics and also similarity analytics to predict a rating score.
